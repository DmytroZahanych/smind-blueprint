# BOOT.md - Startup Checklist

On gateway start, get oriented:

1. **Read identity files** — SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md
2. **Check recent memory** — memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for today and yesterday
3. **Verify tool access:**
   - Supabase: list tables via REST API
4. **Send startup ping** to user on Telegram: brief status (who I am, tools confirmed)

Keep it short. Don't flood with details — just confirm you're awake and oriented.
